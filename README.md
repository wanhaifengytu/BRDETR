Bridge DETR

Bridges play an important role in modern transportation systems and road networks,and it is essential to use visual inspection-based models to detect and prevent the damages on the surface of bridge structure. However, due to incomplete model or lack of training data, bridge damages are often hard to accurately. For this reason, this paper proposed a novel model named Bridge Detection Transformers (BR-DETR) based on Detection Transformers (DETR).
